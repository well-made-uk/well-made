## You’re probably thinking, “who the heck cares?!”
If so, you’re either not involved in building websites, or you’re asking the wrong questions.

Part of the reason I made this blog was to experiment with what was the absolute least a website needed to be:

- Suitable for its intended purpose,
- Fast,
- SEO-friendly,
- Privacy-friendly, and
- Accessible

For example, I didn’t put a navigation list in the header. It didn’t seem to pass any of the criteria. I figured that its effect would be very minor, but only negative. Useless content can reduce both accessibility and performance.

I occasionally make a few tweaks to improve one or more of the above criteria. I’ve already posted about how [there are tools to help us with some of them](https://well-made.uk/blog/2021-06-01-how-to-score-100-on-google-lighthouse), but Google does not produce a tool to help us improve privacy or user experience (although it does help us with a few bits like cumulative layout shift).

## Some things just take time.
That’s why, after a couple of weeks of having my blog, I decided it was time to re-visit the header navigation.

When we arrive in a new place, we either unconsciously or consciously make a mental map of our environment. We take note of the people around us and the different routes we could take from there on.

I realised that, as part of the process each visitor goes through when they reach a website for the first time, a similar mapping-out takes place. The header navigation is probably the most important part of this. Even if a visitor doesn’t click on anything in the navigation, it helps to create a feeling of comfort if they can make a mental map of the routes that they can take.

I also realised that the navigation forms the index of the story that is told throughout the website. Similarly to how someone might scan the table of contents to see what a new book might bring them, the items one chooses to include in their navigation tells visitors what this website is about, and helps them to inform a decision on whether it’s what they were looking for or not.

## How to make a good header navigation
If your website were a book, which chapters would you want to include, and what would you call them?

How many chapters should it have? If your navigation has 20 links, then it’s akin to a huge volume of text, and that’s probably not how you want your visitors to feel.

Also, a final note on “hamburger menus”: they make sense on mobile. But they don’t make sense on desktop. People can’t make a mental map out of three lines in the corner, and accessibility is thrown out of the window. We all like our websites to look nice, but this is just a few steps too far.
