When I was a teenager and first started using the internet, I had around 3 or so online accounts. These were for websites that required the storage and management of data: social and chat services. Password management wasn’t required then, because we could fit all of our passwords on a post it note, with room to spare. This was in around 2010. Things have changed beyond recognition in the 11 years between.

## Password Managers
I use the password manager built in to Safari to keep all my online accounts stored. It’s really good because it follows me between Apple devices, requires no setup, and it’s just easy to use. I don’t know much about the security of it but I’m told it’s good (I’m one of those people that still struggles to see the benefit of being secure online).

I have over 100 passwords stored, including work stuff, social networks, shops, and accounts with home and public services. If I didn’t do a regular clearcut, I’d probably have half a thousand accounts. That’s for someone who’s quite careful not to make unused accounts and always chooses/prefers to browse as a guest. It’s an extremely large digital footprint, and frankly, it slightly terrifies me.

## Clearouts
Every few months, I get frustrated at the length of the list of passwords I have stored, and go through them, one by one, deleting everything I don’t need or use. During these clearouts, I’ve found that the main offenders are online stores that I’ve made a one-off purchase with, and they sneakily created an account for me while I did so. Safari is clever and it knows it’s happened, somehow.

Every time I have a clearout, I find fewer extraneous passwords than I did last time. That’s partly because every time I do a clearout I tackle a few of the beasts that like to make it really difficult to delete an account (there some large companies that I’ve been trying to get to delete my data for several years now). It’s also because, every time I have one, the anti-account ideology is lodged further and further into my brain, and will refuse to buy many things just because they require me to create an account.

## Why?!
There are many reasons that companies want to keep an account for you. For one, it’s (sort of) free money for the companies. They don’t have to pay for marketing or personal details - they’ve already got yours, along with permission to “remarket” to you. It’s also for regulatory compliance - it’s the “easy” way to keep track of people’s data - add them to a line in the database and give them access to edit it themselves.

## Your Knight in Shining Armour
I suppose this is a bit of an odd rant to have, because I don’t really have a solution. I ain’t the one to solve this.

It definitely is another case where we should be asking: Do we actually need this? If you have a store, especially, ask whether you need to have user accounts, and ask if you can make them optional.

Other than that, I’ve got nothing. More frequent clearouts, maybe?
