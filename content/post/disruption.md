I wrote recently about doing the right thing. I realised that it sort of sounds like I’m inciting disruption, so I wanted to write a short afterword to that.

## Disruptive technology
I’m constantly reminded that I’m quite a technophobe for someone working in technology. I dislike smartphones (and still haven’t made the jump), I’m suspicious of alternative forms of transportation, and I like hailing a taxi with my actual thumb.

Industries that would have been considered fast-growing 10 years ago would now be considered stagnant. Constant revolution and disruption is now considered a healthy pace of change. Consumer demand (and a global pandemic) have fuelled a baffling array of changes to the core of living over the past few years, and quite simple and once-enjoyable experiences are quite challenging for the old-fashioned thinkers amongst us.

Things that were added to the growing list of things you can only do with a smartphone this year include sitting in or ordering from most bars or restaurants, and viewing a bus timetable. Several times, waiters have handed me their smartphones to browse through the menu on, which is a hygienic and personal concern of mine, because they’ve had no physical menus at all. I also now have to stand at a bus stop hoping that buses do indeed come here on Sunday and go roughly in the direction that I’m hoping they’ll go.

In the slightly less annoying category of things that now have a lot of friction without a smartphone is: making an appointment at my GP. It is possible to do this by calling up (which is an affair all of its own, requiring me to walk 100 yards up my hill to get reception), getting a telephone appointment about 2 weeks later, to then be told that I’ll need a physical appointment, another 2 weeks later again. This is even the case if I need a blood test, which I’m pretty sure cannot be done during a telephone appointment.

I need to move on, so I don’t sound like a privileged ageing man (despite being 27 years of age).

## Evolution
Maybe it’s just my lack of mental capacity for new things, but I can’t help having the feeling that fast-moving disruptions like these are pretty on-inclusive. The vast majority of my village is made up of over-60s, and pub socials tend to take the form of “things I struggle to understand nowadays”, in which I fit very well. Older folks, old-fashioned folks, rural folks, and less physically and mentally able folks will all have trouble with the revolutionary nature of modern technical and social change. Slow may be frustrating to 21st-century society, but I would also argue that it’s quite necessary, and quite nice, too.

Another metaphor: I have a canal boat. I got it because I quite like doing things slowly and with a sense of misplaced serenity. On one of my first outings, however, I had a slight fracas with another boater who was clearly firmly in the 21st-century boat (lol), and collided with me at a full 4 miles per hour, out of frustration at my speed. It was a bit upsetting, and he knocked my bloody chimney off.

We have two choices: set our gear at a full 4 miles per hour and smash into anything that gets in our way, causing damage, frustration and upset to anyone slower than us, or take a slightly slower pace, taking the time to pass around others respectfully, allowing them to retain their grace and dignity.

Conclusion: I am not trying to incite disruption. You can create positive change gradually and inclusively. You can even move quite quickly in doing so, as long as you ensure that your ideas are alternative to, and improve, the current system, instead of replacing it. Don’t make a taxi company that forces traditional taxi companies off the road - make one that supplements and improves it. Don’t smash existing ideas off course and knock their chimneys off - slow down and pass gracefully.
