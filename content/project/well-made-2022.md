Every year, I publish at least one large update to well-made.uk. I like to experiment with new technologies and designs, and keep things fresh. This year, the first big update focuses on content organisation and editorial process. Content management is now simpler and more straightforward, thanks to the new platform that powers the website: [a static site generator called Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

The website should be ***even faster***, and I can now write my blog posts and projects in markdown. I've added a new content category - projects - and I can make my project pages more rich and appealing in future. There's a dark mode, which is pretty neat, and visual improvements all-round (see the before-after views below). It's better on mobile, and I've made room for more "evergreen" content: specifically, info on why I don't use Google services, and more.

Gone is the very fun, yet very large, header, and replaced by a smaller one to give me room to fill it with more strange stuff. The page itself is slightly wider, giving me room for a second column and to keep everything above the fold.

You may not be aware of this, but my blog isn't really very interesting. The posts are written in very inconsistent styles about all sorts of things, and it's just generally chaotic. The new design reflects this, by showing a wide selection of my writings in one place. Each article loses focuses, in favour of giving you the choice of reading about a wide range of things. Also - and don't tell anyone this - the oagination in the old blog hadn't been working for months. It is now :)

The blog posts are much more rich. There are shortcodes in Hugo for notices (like the blue box at the top of this post), and the theme, be default, shows readtime, categories, tags, and author (though I've disabled this). There's a permalink generator for every heading in every post, and I added a '#' before headings, to reflect my new markdown approach to writing.
