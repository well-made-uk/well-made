I’ve recently been building a ticket-style job management system that I want to eventually turn into a really cool little side business. The part of that which is relevant is the software I based it on.

[Hesk](https://www.hesk.com/) is actually a super nifty little ticket management software, despite the way the website makes it look. It’s really nicely made, the code is well-written and documented, and the owners are helpful. It’s also free and you can set it up in under an hour.

After working on my new app for a few weeks, I realised that I could use Hesk to help me take back control of my own spare time, my email inbox, and my personal phone.

## Taking back control
Previously, people would contact me through my personal email address (it’s a [hey.com](https://hey.com/) email, so it’s easy to filter out people I don’t want to get messages from, but sadly I cannot ignore clients), my personal phone, or even my home landline.

I only have a handful of clients now since joining an agency. Certain clients know the score, and keep it to Slack or the occasional email. Other clients, not so much. I have one client who calls my mobile phone and landline at least twice a day, every day, including weekends, and even comes to my home address if I don’t respond quickly enough. Short of getting a restraining order, I clearly need to set better boundaries with clients now.

We all want to be the flexible developer who’s always available and always personable, but the truth is that I don’t want to work 24/7, and I don’t particularly like phone calls either.

Why a ticket system is essential, even if you only have one client
It doesn’t take 50 clients to make you busy. Your first and only client can be the type that emails you several times a day. A ticket system stops this from happening.

I now have a dedicated ticket system just for my freelance clients, and that also makes it easier to have “official” support hours. I will no longer accept phone calls or emails from my clients - they all go through my support system. I can choose to switch off notifications when I feel like it, and I only need to open up my dashboard on days I’m planning to work. There are clearly set rules about what clients have to do when they have a problem, and my support days (Mon-Thurs) are stated on every reply I send.

## How does it feel?
It’s awesome.

I’ve been trying to move towards having more spare time during evenings and weekends for the past year, but nothing seemed to work. In one change, however, I instantly have every evening and a 3-day weekend to myself, every week.

Seriously, do it. Even if you only have 1 client.
