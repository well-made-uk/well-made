Things have been quiet on well-made.uk, but a lot's been going on under the hood. Quick round-up:

## Project Lloyd
I mentioned previously that I'd started using a tool called Udesly to turn my Webflow sites into static Netlify/Jamstack apps. I also mentioned it was a bit buggy, and since then I noticed several ways I could improve on the workflow. This is why I built Project Lloyd.

I was inspired by the app Cryolayer to build a static site converter with various optimisations and plugin support. I wanted to build something to use with well-made.uk and also future client sites. It takes the launched Webflow subdomain, auto-adds (privacy-friendly) analytics, inlines critical CSS, optimises images, and deploys it as a static site on Netlify. Netlify has build hooks, meaning that every time I publish a change, it builds again and deploys a new version on Netlify. Let me know if you want to hear more about it.

## Personal changes
Another big change for me: I'm no longer agency-based! I'm now fully freelance to devote my time to building well-made websites in the way I believe is the best for the future of the Internet! I've also taken the opportunity to create a PDF portfolio which I'll keep updated with my work, and you can now reach me on Telegram from the site footer.

And this brings me into the next change:

## Website redesign
I've wanted to do a redesign for a while, and made several attempts, but couldn't get the tone right. I'm not quite finished, but take a look around and you'll see it's a lot more colourful over here! It's Project Lloyd's first serious project, and it's more focused around me as a freelancer, demonstrating my past work in a more friendly way. There's now a site header with navigation, too.

## Upcoming changes
There's a bit more optimisation to do here. I've commissioned a series of new graphics and illustrations to use on-site and in my documentation. I'll also be doing a series of audits on this site to practice my post-launch workflow for future projects. I'll be using performance tracking and user experience testing to make sure I'm doing things right, and I'll continue on my accessibility journey by adding more audits and checks on that side, too. This is all a gradual move so that I can gain the most knowledge possible from each step of the way.
