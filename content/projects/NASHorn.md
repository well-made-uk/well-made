NASHorn is a non-medicinal prescription application for managing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. It's in German language but the graphics and interactions are fun in any language. [Visit NASHorn here.](https://nashorn.app)

I designed and built this landing page to be super simple, fast and accessible. It was the first commercial project that uses [Project Lloyd](/posts/lloyd).
