## Exciting news: I’ve been nominated for an Awwward.
Well - maybe not so exciting, since I already failed to make it into any category. And, looking around the nominees, it’s easy to see why.

Among the contenders we have websites for lamps made out of recycled umbrellas, large media and branding agencies, multi-national energy companies and more, all harnessing the latest in WebGL distortions and animation, packed with exciting colours and images, and frankly ridiculous scrolling behaviour.

My site is fairly small and simple, using nicely designed and colourful SVGs and a couple of animated GIFs, and a quiz with a really smooth and lovely user experience and reporting tool.

## I’m stupid
Perhaps it’s just me. Perhaps I’m stupid. All of the colours and interactions and animations just seem like friction to me. With all of this going on, it’s really difficult to see where I’m meant to click, and to be honest, I often don’t even know what the website is for.

Even if I’m stupid, I’m certainly not alone in that. I’d guess that most web users are at least as stupid as me.

## What it means for web design
I work at a marketing and web development agency, and when a client tells me they found a website they like on Awwwards, I die a little inside. The website’s prestige and notoriety means that it’s helping to make this the new standard of web design.

We’re leaving the age of UX and (re-)entering the age of websites looking like a teenager’s diary, covered in stickers, glitter, and statements like “I (heart) Troy”.

Thank goodness I didn’t win.
