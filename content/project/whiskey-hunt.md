Bar and Craft's Whiskey Hunt is a directory of rare and fine whiskeys. [Visit whiskey hunt here.](https://www.barandcraft.com/tools/whiskey-hunt)

I built Whiskey Hunt in Bubble. It's a fully-featured app:
- Algolia-powered search
- Autocomplete & geolocate
- Magic login emails
- Account & listing management
- Website integration
- Responsive design
- PWA compatible

It's also really tiny and fun to use.

## Bubble Workflows
The functionality is handled with no code by Bubble's workflows:

This means that the clients themselves can make changes and edits in future. That's a part of what makes a well-made website: making sure that the app is usable by all its intended users, including the client.
