Henlo.

Today, in a reflective mood, I took a walk around my neighbourhood. It was, as Dylan Moran would describe, "fierce mild"; the swathes of rain lapped against my face and dripped from the end of my nose, and the wind made it quite difficult to send voice notes to my partner. The severity was slightly above the mundane. At one point I saw a middle-aged couple embrace while their baby's pram started to roll down the hill. It didn't get far, but I found myself fixated. I won't comment on whether I was struck by fear or amused (knowing as well as you do that actively refusing to do so clearly indicates my guilt). Nevertheless, my reflections brought me to what I thought would be something worth writing about.

When I made this blog last year, I thought it'd be a good career move to have some kind of credibility and show that I have at least a modicum of industry awareness and technical prowess. However, it actually ended up being a lot bigger than that. As part of my 'Benaissance', this blog has become a defiant stand against "the career move" in general; rebelliously dull, absurdly indulgent, and ridiculously inconsistent. Its ebbs and flows represent a turbulent year for a web developer living in the UK during a pandemic and during a life. Here's a roughly chronological representation of what I now believe were the most important things in the year:

- The year started slowly and happily; the lockdown restrictions suited me well and my job was going well, if not a bit unsatisfying.
- My promotion to a role with the word "manager" in the name gave me a general feel of seniority. I took the new role gladly, even buying myself an executive commuter's car and a pair of smart shoes.
- I made a fascinating and sage-like friend in Maurice (a fictional name), an Irish fellow I'd met online. He was objective, warmly cold, and analytical. I'd found something good. I borrowed books from his collection and took on a similarly sage-like persona.
- I firmly stated to others that I do not like music, poetry, or flights of fancy. I was a grown-up, I was serious, and I was busy and important. Not many people believed me. To paraphrase Jose Saramago in The Cave: we cannot pretend to others, only to ourselves.
- I watched as my agency committed more and more ridiculous acts of inhumanity. As work and life brought me further and further into mental health struggles, they seemed to actively work against me, denying the effects of mental health, refusing to let me work from home or take any time off to recover, and talked about me (and others) in increasingly inappropriate and unpleasant ways. The workplace started to decline into toxicity.
- Disaster after disaster struck; two separate attempts at having a working vehicle were quelled by the inconsistency of engineering processes (or my inability to look after a car).
- My narrowboat broke down in the most dramatic way possible: at the start of a 3-week journey, which was to mark my new life living on a narrowboat, and with the disastrous consequence of having to find a 1930s combustion engine and matching gearbox to replace my new defunct one.
- With support from a slightly more varied friend-group, I realised that, in fact, I do love music, poetry, folly, Persons, and all other wonderful things. I promptly left my job, and the tide of fate completely turned: I had a chance meeting with a man with whom I now live and love, I moved to a rather delightful flat in the nearby city, and I'm letting out my house for holiday accommodation, which fills me with constant joy. My freelance work has been overwhelmingly positive, letting me work on much more interesting projects for causes I really do believe in.

I want to mention this: When you consider leaving a job, your own anxieties and doubts are the tip of the iceberg. Any friends you have with social credibility will tell you it's a bad idea and that you should be careful. Let me tell you this: **if you have the means to do it, then do it**. I don't want to speak in ignorance - I know that my being white and notionally middle-class puts me in a very strong position to leave a job, but if your job brings you to a position that you have to be admitted to hospital with heart palpitations, **you need to leave**. I would never say that to your face, but hidden behind a wall of text on a blog post, I feel it must be said. You may go through a time of difficulty, but beyond that, a good place awaits you.

This is not a weird blog post. It's actually incredibly normal and worthwhile. This blog is not a career move, it's my way of saying that I do life on my own terms. I deleted my LinkedIn (in a world where flesh and bones don't make you corporeal anymore; it's your online presence that determines your level of existence), and all other presence I had online, apart from this, my own haven in which I can write in whichever form I like, adjust and twist at will, and fear no evil (because, after all, there's only really one person that reads this, at most).

So 2021 was the year of Benaissance: how I realised that I love silliness, and living in my own silly way is well worth doing.
