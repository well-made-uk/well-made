{{<notice info Update>}}My idea of well-made websites is more clear and concise than ever before, so I updated this post from 25/05/2021 and re-published it.{{</notice>}}

## The internet is rubbish
Every website is trying to stand out - so they end up with tons of images, bright colours, popups, fancy scripts, and fonts that make things difficult to read and slow to load. These are not well-made websites.

On top of that, [the average web page produces 1.76g CO2 every time someone visits](https://www.websitecarbon.com/). These are not well-made, either.

And, in case you didn’t realise, most websites track what you’re doing, even after you’ve left them. Not cool.

## What’s a well-made website?
Well-made websites only use images, scripts and styles when they are relevant, try to use files we have on our computers already, and have a low carbon footprint.

They are quick to deploy, easy to edit, and accessible for all to view.

They give people the information they came for, and don’t force people to search around for it. Well-made websites don’t track you, and leave you free to browse as you wish.

## How do you make them?
My suggestion: start with a really simple template, like the one on this site. Wrap it up with your brand’s header and footer, style it up nicely, and hook it up to your other projects.

Manage your content with a really nice CMS, like [Perch](https://grabaperch.com/) or [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). Consider whether you actually need analytics. If you do, use something like [Plausible](https://plausible.io/) or [Fathom](https://usefathom.com/).

Tools like [Website Carbon](https://www.websitecarbon.com/) can tell you what your website’s carbon footprint is.

Finally, think about accessibility. What about people with screen-readers? What about people who find reading from a screen difficult? Get your colour contrast right, [structure your content well](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/headings/) with good [semantic code](http://html5doctor.com/lets-talk-about-semantics/).

This is how I make websites - if you're interested, please [get in touch](mailto:ben-wilde@hey.com).
