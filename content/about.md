I'm a web developer who cares *a lot* about websites, the internet, and digital privacy. I make websites that are fast, accessible, and [respect users' data](/google-free/).

I build websites with:

* [Webflow](https://webflow.io), a no-code site builder
* [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), a really simple site generator
* [Netlify](https://netlify.app/), a very clever (and fast) hosting service
* [GitHub](https://github.com/), a version management system

... among other things.

See some of my work in [projects](/project/) or on [GitHub](https://github.com/well-made-uk).
