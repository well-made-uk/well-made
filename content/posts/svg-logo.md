I made a little animated SVG for my website. It was really simple: I just loaded the SVG into [SVGArtista](https://svgartista.net/) and let it do its thing. There’s not a huge amount of customisation available but I’m happy with what it can do.

There’s an option for stroke drawing and an option to fade in any fills gradually. It gives you an edited SVG code and a CSS animation.
