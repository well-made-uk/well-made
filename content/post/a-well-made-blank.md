Spike Lee’s 1989 film, “Do The Right Thing”, has wider messages about looking at what you’re doing, and breaking free of harmful norms in order to stop perpetuating something harmful or damaging.

Today I’ve been thinking about what this means for my industry. I’ve been told that this little blog of mine is pretty boring. However, in essence, it’s my little attempt to do the right thing within my industry. It’s my attempt to look at the harmful spiralling direction of the industry towards a World Wide Web with high levels of consumption, invasion of privacy, and continually decreasing level of access to fringe users - those with differing ability, and those in lifestyles that make internet browsing difficult.

Hopefully you'll be able to agree with me that the World Wide Web that we had as kids (or young adults) looked far more like the ideal version of itself than it does now. This trajectory is often changed by trends and disruptive technology, but it remains roughly downward when it comes to the important stuff.

## Finding information
Sure enough, sophisticated search engines make it easier for us to find answers, but in order for websites to be picked by those search engines, they need to fill their content with unnecessary and unwanted guff, meaning that instead of finding 1-2 websites that answer your question well, you now find 100,000-200,000 websites that merely confuse and frustrate you.

We never wanted thousands of results - we just wanted one good one.

## Downloading information
The number of developers and agencies who work to reduce the carbon footprint of their products is extremely low. I don’t have stats here - but just look around you. Stick a bunch of your favourite websites through [Website Carbon](http://websitecarbon.com/) and see what I mean. The web, and each individual website, is growing in footprint, and fast. When you download an answer to a simple question you entered into a search engine, you’re also downloading countless images, extra data, styling, ads, sharing and tracking scripts, etc. Stuff you never asked for, will (hopefully) barely notice, and will take away from, rather than add to, your experience.

## Using information
When you find an article worth reading, you quickly find the true goal of the writer; things will pop up, paywalls will stop you reading it, distracting (and large) images will appear, confusing messages will try to persuade you to buy, subscribe to or attend things you never asked for. Even if you simply find and open a video promising to answer a very specific question (such as “how to delete images in Wordpress”) will occupy you for the next 8 minutes, with only 30 seconds’ worth of relevant information.

## Trading information
Something I truly cannot stand about the way the internet stands today is making and managing accounts. 10 years ago, I’d likely have had around 3 internet accounts. Today, I probably have 300. This is partly because I work online and rely on a number of online services to do my job. However, that can only account for, say, 5% of these. The rest was just to access small pieces of information I had needed at a time, to request help for certain products or services, or to buy something for one of my hobbies (such as music production). I occasionally go on a clear-out mission, deleting sometimes 100 accounts in a month. Unfortunately, around half of these take up to a month to delete, as I have to make contact with owners that clearly don’t want to be contacted and persuade them why they should do this for me, despite the regulations that were put in place.

## Sharing information
When I was growing up, I used MSN Messenger to chat with friends. It opened up, you logged in, and there was an uninterrupted experience from then on. There were bugs aplenty but we all knew how to close and re-open an application.

To share something now, you need one or more of the popular social networks. For a while I tried to avoid Facebook services, as I still have an old-fashioned outlook on the sharing of my personal data. This means that, instead of using the most popular chatting app, I had to use a combination of 6 different apps in order to have a way to chat to all of my close friends and family. Some of the apps were used to talk to one friend only, because that was the only one they had (other than one of the Facebook apps). That meant 6 different accounts, or more.

Sadly, if you want to protect yourself and your privacy online and still be in touch with your friends and family, you need to share your information with strangers who are well-known for selling it on or using it to influence various economic and political processes. That’s the world we live in, and no app or website has managed to make a truly disruptive difference here.

## Doing the right thing
They were just a few of the examples - of which I’m sure I could list over 100 - of damaging behaviours within the industry of web development.

However, I’m not just talking about web developers here. I’m talking about whatever work you do, whatever industry you influence or affect, whatever circles you move in. What can you do to break free of downward spirals of harmful behaviour? How can you move towards making more well-made blanks within your area?

I realise this blog may be boring - but hopefully others will agree that it’s also important.
